<p>My name is Anna Jacobsen and I show entrepreneurs how marketing automation can increase their conversions – especially through email automation.</p>

<p>I joined Drip as employee #3, and a year later, Drip got acquired by <a href="https://www.leadpages.net/">Leadpages</a>, which kept every Drip employee in their existing roles. The acquisition prompted a move from Drip HQ in sunny California to Leadpages HQ in Minnesota (<em>brrr</em>), and also allowed me to watch Drip become the fastest-growing marketing automation platform on the planet.</p>

<p>I authored <a href="https://www.convertedu.com/courses/drip-consultant-certification/">Drip’s Consultant Certification Program</a>, <a href="https://www.convertedu.com/courses/drip-getting-started/">new user training course</a>, and <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/dripworkflows">guide to workflow automation</a>.</p>

<p>I make occasional appearances at conferences and on webinars and podcasts, talking about email marketing, automation, sales, and onboarding:
<ul>
<li>Onboarding and Customer Success: How to Get Your Customers on the Minimum Path to Awesome (<a href="https://automatedconference.com/">Automated</a>)</li>
<li>How Drip gets qualified signups onto demos​ (<a href="http://stackshare.tv">StackShare.tv</a>)</li>
<li>Lessons Learned From A Year Of Product Demos At Drip (<a href="http://microconf.com">MicroConf</a>)</li>
<li>Giant Robots Smashing Into Other Giant Robots (<a href="http://giantrobots.fm/230">Episode 230</a>)</li>
</ul>
 
<p>I live and work in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I'm most active on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/annagjacobsen">@annagjacobsen</a>. If you like reading tweets about martech, you should definitely follow me there.</p>
