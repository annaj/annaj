I believe the most resilient growth channel for any company comes from helping your customers achieve their goals.<br />
<br />
Currently, I'm leading a team that does this at YouCanBook.me.<br />
<br />
In the past, I did this at Drip.<br />
<br />
Occasionally, I'll speak on customer-driven growth, sometimes at conferences, sometimes online.<br />
<br />
If you'd like to get in touch, DM me on <a href="http://twitter.com/annagjacobsen/">Twitter</a>.
