Hey there, my name's Anna Jacobsen. Since you're here, you might be like me – focusing on the potential of customer-driven growth.<br />
<br />
I’ve worked with early-stage startups for the past ten years, and I believe the most resilient growth channel for any company comes from helping your customers achieve their goals.<br />
<br />
Currently, I'm leading a team that does this at YouCanBook.me.<br />
<br />
In the past, I did this at Drip.<br />
<br />
Occasionally, I'll speak on customer-driven growth, sometimes at conferences, sometimes online.<br />
<br />
I've learned a lot about customer experience and success over the years. I'm happy to share what I know to help companies of all sizes leverage their most reliable growth channel: the success of their customers. If you want to start a conversation, please <a href="https://www.annajacobsen.com/contact/">get in touch</a>.
